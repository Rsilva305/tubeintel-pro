# Onboarding Fix Documentation

## Issue
The application was showing the error: 
> Failed to update profile: Could not find the 'has_completed_onboarding' column of 'profiles' in the schema cache

This occurred during the onboarding process when a user tried to continue to the dashboard after selecting a channel.

## Fix Applied
On June 20, 2024, the following fix was applied:

1. Added the missing `has_completed_onboarding` column to the `profiles` table
2. Set the column to `true` for existing profiles that had a YouTube channel ID
3. Created a migration file to document the change

## SQL Applied
```sql
-- Add the has_completed_onboarding column to the profiles table
ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS has_completed_onboarding BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Update existing profiles
-- If a profile has a youtube_channel_id, consider it as having completed onboarding
UPDATE public.profiles 
SET has_completed_onboarding = true 
WHERE youtube_channel_id IS NOT NULL AND youtube_channel_id != '';
```

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use database migrations for schema changes
2. Ensure that database schema changes are committed alongside code changes
3. Test schema changes in development environments before deploying to production
