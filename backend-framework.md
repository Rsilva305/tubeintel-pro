# Backend Framework for TubeIntel Pro

## Overview

TubeIntel Pro is an advanced YouTube analytics and competitor research platform designed for creators, agencies, and automation-driven entrepreneurs. This document outlines the backend framework specification, detailing the architecture, design patterns, and implementation strategies for building a robust and scalable application using Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL.

---

## 1. API Architecture and Endpoints Organization

### 1.1 RESTful API Design Patterns

- **Base URL**: `/api/v1`
- **Endpoint Structure**:
  - Real-Time VPH Alerts: `/alerts/vph`
  - Competitor Channel Tracker: `/competitors/{channelId}`
  - Transcript + Metadata Scraper: `/scraper/{videoId}`
  - Automation & Export to Google Sheets: `/automation/export`
  - AI-Powered Viral Insights: `/insights/viral`

### 1.2 Naming Conventions

- Use nouns for resources (e.g., `/alerts`, `/competitors/{id}`).
- Use HTTP methods to denote actions (e.g., POST for create, GET for read).

### 1.3 Request/Response Formats

- **Request Example**:
  ```json
  POST /api/v1/alerts/vph
  {
    "videoId": "abc123",
    "threshold": 1000
  }
  ```

- **Response Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
      "alertId": "alert456",
      "message": "VPH alert created successfully."
    }
  }
  ```

### 1.4 Versioning Strategy

- Use URL versioning: `/api/v1/...`.
- Maintain backward compatibility and deprecate older versions with advance notices.

### 1.5 Middleware Organization

- **Logging**: Use `morgan` for request logging.
- **Authentication**: JWT verification middleware.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware.
- **Rate Limiting**: `express-rate-limit` for throttling requests.

### 1.6 Route Handlers

- Separate business logic into service layer.
- Controllers handle request validation and responses.

## 2. Database Schema Design

### 2.1 ORM Integration

- Use Prisma for interacting with PostgreSQL.
- Define models in schema.prisma:
  ```prisma
  model User {
    id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
    email     String   @unique
    password  String
    role      String
  }
  ```

### 2.2 Connection Optimization

- Use connection pooling with `pg-pool`.
- Set appropriate pool size based on server capacity.

### 2.3 Transaction Management

- Use Prisma's transaction API for atomic operations.

### 2.4 Query Optimization

- Indexing on frequently queried columns.
- Use EXPLAIN to analyze and optimize query plans.

### 2.5 Migration Approach

- Use Prisma Migrate for schema migrations.
- Version control migration files and retain migration history.

---

## 3. Authentication/Authorization

### 3.1 JWT Implementation

- Use `jsonwebtoken` for signing and verifying tokens.
- Store JWT secret in environment variables.

### 3.2 OAuth 2.0 Integration

- Optional: Integrate with Google OAuth for user sign-in.

### 3.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Assign roles (e.g., admin, user) and restrict routes based on roles.

### 3.4 Session Management

- Stateless JWT authentication. No server-side session storage.

### 3.5 Refresh Token Strategies

- Implement refresh tokens with longer expiry.
- Store refresh tokens securely in a database.

---

## 4. Error Handling Strategy

### 4.1 Centralized Error Handling

- Use middleware to handle and log errors.
- Send standardized error responses.

### 4.2 Custom Error Classes

- Define error classes for different error types (e.g., `ValidationError`).

### 4.3 Logging and Monitoring

- Integrate with a logging service (e.g., Winston) and monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry).

### 4.4 User-Friendly Error Responses

- Provide clear error messages with codes for client-side handling.

### 4.5 Error Recovery

- Implement retry logic for transient errors.

---

## 5. Performance Considerations

### 5.1 Caching Strategies

- Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
- Cache API responses where applicable.

### 5.2 Rate Limiting

- Implement `express-rate-limit` to prevent abuse.

### 5.3 Database Connection Pooling

- Optimize pool size based on load testing.

### 5.4 Query Optimization

- Regularly review slow queries and optimize them.

### 5.5 Horizontal Scaling

- Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer.

---

## 6. Security Implementations

### 6.1 Input Validation

- Use `express-validator` to sanitize and validate input.

### 6.2 CSRF Protection

- Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations.

### 6.3 CORS Configuration

- Configure CORS to allow only trusted origins.

### 6.4 SQL Injection Prevention

- Use parameterized queries and ORM features.

### 6.5 XSS Protection

- Output encoding and use security headers.

### 6.6 Rate Limiting

- Protect against brute-force attacks with rate limiting.

### 6.7 Data Encryption

- Use HTTPS for data in transit.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using PostgreSQL features.

---

## 7. Testing Strategy

### 7.1 Unit Testing

- Use Jest for unit testing individual modules.

### 7.2 Integration Testing

- Use Supertest for testing API endpoints with database interaction.

### 7.3 End-to-End Testing

- Use Cypress for simulating user interactions.

### 7.4 Mock Frameworks

- Use `sinon` for mocking and stubbing dependencies.

---

## 8. Deployment and DevOps

### 8.1 CI/CD Pipeline

- Integrate with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

### 8.2 Environment Configuration

- Use `dotenv` for environment variables management.

### 8.3 Containerization

- Use Docker for containerization and consistent deployment environments.

### 8.4 Infrastructure as Code

- Use Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure management.
