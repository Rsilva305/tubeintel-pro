## 2. Timeline Estimates

### Week-by-Week Breakdown
1. **Weeks 1-3**: Planning, design, and resource allocation.
2. **Weeks 4-8**: Core development and MVP finalization.
3. **Weeks 9-12**: Feature integration and alpha testing.
4. **Weeks 13-16**: Enhanced development and beta testing.
5. **Weeks 17-20**: Final refinements and production release.
6. **Weeks 21-32**: Post-launch enhancements.

### Resource Allocation
- **Development Team**: 3-5 developers
- **Design Team**: 2 UI/UX designers
- **Testing Team**: 2 QA engineers
- **Management**: 1 project manager

### Critical Path and Dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Feature development depends on completion of architecture design.
- **Critical Path**: Core functionality must be completed before additional features.

### Buffer Periods
- Allocate 1 week per phase for unexpected challenges.

### Key Milestones
- MVP completion by Week 8
- Production release by Week 20

## 3. Feature Prioritization

### MoSCoW Method
- **Must have**: Real-Time VPH Alerts, Competitor Channel Tracker
- **Should have**: Transcript + Metadata Scraper
- **Could have**: Automation & Export to Google Sheets
- **Won't have**: Additional analytics until post-launch

### Impact vs. Effort Matrix
Focus on high-impact, low-effort features initially.

### Value-Driven Development
Prioritize features providing the most significant user benefits.

### User-Centric Prioritization
Features are prioritized based on direct feedback from target users.

### Technical Dependencies
Real-Time VPH Alerts require robust backend infrastructure prior to implementation.

### Risk Assessment
Evaluate each feature for potential development and integration risks.
